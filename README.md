I'm intending to merge these two cordova plugins into one, which can be simply used for both iOS and Andorid without further troubles:
1. https://github.com/poiuytrez/AndroidInAppBilling
2. https://github.com/j3k0/PhoneGap-InAppPurchase-iOS

Fill free to contribute, specially because I'm not really familiar with Objective-C.

I prefered the android plugin style more mainly because:
* it is more similar to the promise pattern in JavaScript than the other
* it allows for individual callbacks as simple as global ones

Until the unified documentations is ready, you can access the platform specific documentations on
* for Android on ANDROIDREADME.md
* for iOS on IOSREADME.md
